Utility Functions
The final three functions are what I like to call utility of miscellaneous functions.
They don't necessarily fit into the other categories and so they will be covered here:

toString() converts an array to a string and returns the result
isArray() used to check whether the object passed to it is an array. Returns true if is and false it's not.
map() iterates through each element in the array and allows you to call a function repeatedly to process code on each element one at a time.

The array object's toString() method works just like the toString() method works on other objects. It simply converts an array to a string, and returns the result:

var names = ["Zak", "Fred", "Sally", "Jessica", "John", "Mike"];
window.document.write(names.toString());

Returns 
Zak, Fred, Sally, Jessica, John, Mike

Instead of
["Zak", "Fred", "Sally", "Jessica", "John", "Mike"];
window.document.write(names.toString());

Returns 
Zak, Fred, Sally, Jessica, John, Mike

Instead Of
["Zak", "Fred", "Sally", "Jessica", "John", "Mike"]
