Web Storage
Allows a web site store and persist data on the user's system
Data persistence in JavaScript can be handled by using hidden fields, cookies, Local Storage and Session Storage
Local storage is retained indefinetly whereas sessions storage is lost once the browser is closed

Web storage works like cookies. Cookies however, web storage is much simpler to work with

localStorage.saveItem("itemname", "value")
localStorage.getItem("itemname")
localStorage.removeItem("itemname")
localStorage.clear()

localStorage.itemname

Using web storage to create a simple page hit counter
<p> You have visited this page
<output>
    <script>
        if (localStorage.hits) {
            localStorage.hits = Number(localStorage.hits) + 1;
        } else {
            localStorage.hits = 1;
        }
        document.write(localStorage.hits);
    </script>
</output>
time(s).</p>
